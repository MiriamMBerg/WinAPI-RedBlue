# WinAPI-RedBlue
Source codes of Windows API Exploitation for Red and Blue teams from Pentester Academy.

In this I will include my own research learning I have put through learning Win32 API exploitation from Vivek sir and Pavel sir.

I have organized these learning into "Exploiting Windows API for Red Teaming" series on my blog &rarr; https://tbhaxor.com/exploiting-windows-api-for-red-teaming/
